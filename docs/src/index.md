# AdmissionSuite

[AdmissionSuite](https://github.com/timholy/AdmissionSuite.jl) is designed to help allocate offers of admission, forecast outcomes, and allocate resources across programs.
It was designed around Washington University's [Division of Biology and Biomedical Sciences](https://dbbs.wustl.edu/Pages/index.aspx) (DBBS),
the [first cross-departmental graduate training program in the United States](https://faseb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1096/fba.2020-00122) consisting of many different programs of study with coordinated admissions and funding.

This package also provides a browser-based application that can be used by admissions professionals to manage the
admissions season.
