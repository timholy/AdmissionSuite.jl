The sigma parameters measure the standard deviation, i.e., the tolerance for mismatch (larger sigma are more tolerant of mismatch). Smaller sigma_r increases the importance of choosing applicants of similar rank, and would indicate that there may be a strong rank-dependent element to recruitment (e.g., \"more competitive applicants are harder to recruit\"). Smaller sigma_t increases the importance of the timing of the offer, and would indicate that wait-list offers should be treated quite differently from initial offers. The units of both sigma parameters are those of the NormalizedApplicants, i.e., with values ranging between 0 and 1. For example, setting sigma_t = 02 would, in essence, break the decision period (typically mid-January to April 15th) into roughly 5 periods, and match primarily against applicants who were extended offers during the same period. Note that the applicant ranks will typically be quite heavily weighted to low values (e.g., a program that only accepts the top 20% of applicants will only exhibit ranks between 0.0 and 0.2), and as a consequence sigma_r must be smaller than this span to have large effect.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"This fundamental matching function is augmented by options to:","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"require that the matching applicants are from the same program\nexclude past applicants who had already rendered their decision by this point in the admissions season.
